//Guess my number, computer plays
//
//Implement a version of Guess My Number, where the human chooses a number between 1 and 100, and the computer guesses the number.
//The human should be able to tell the computer whether the computer’s guess was too high, too low, or was the correct answer. Run
//this multiple times and compute the average number of repetitions necessary for the computer to guess the number. Have the program
//print the value, the guess, and the list on each repetition.
//
//Is the human as good as the computer in finding the number?
