//Guess my number, human plays
//
//Implement a version of Guess My Number, where the computer randomly chooses a number between 1 and 1000, and the human guesses the number.
//In this case, the program should print a hint with each repetition, either <Your guess was too high>, <Your guess was too low>,
//or <You guessed the number>. The human should then input the next guess. Run this multiple times and compute the average number
//of repetitions necessary for you to guess the number.
//
//What is the maximum number of guesses you need to guess a number between 1 and 1000? Recall that log2 1000 = 9.966 and that 210 = 1024.
